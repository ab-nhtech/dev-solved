1. Add Virtualized Scrolling

The table needs to load data on every page or on scrolling from the api.
So it should have a virtual scrolling to load only the data which is
needed or displayed.

2. Responsive

The table should be responsive from top to bottom to get the right view
on mobile as well as computer.

3. Support Search Bar

It should support search bar to search the entity needed rather that finding
it on every page which leads more time waste.
